Functional connectivity analysis with Schaefer 2018 500 parcellation atlas with ROI of 172 as estimated target location of TMS
Source Files:
r/lh.Schaefer2018_500Parcels_7Networks_order.annot is the annotation file to visualize the Schaefer 500 atlas
Schaefer500_r/lh_vertexnodes.xlsx contain the node ID for each vertex
Shaefer500_metadata.xlsx contains the descriptors for each node's system and network (generated with createatlasmetadata.m)

Exploratory analysis:
1)shaefer172_ROIconn.m (generates the timesseries data for each node)
2)sch_mris_preproc.job (preps for glm)
3)sch_mri_glm.job (runs paired compairson pre/post)
4) sch_smooth.job (smooths compairson outputs)
5) sch_sigthresh_meanmap.txt (threholds the group average maps be significance)
6) sch_cogchange2connchange.m (runs correlation between cognitive change to connectivity change)

Network analysis:
1)schaefer_coorelation.m (generates connectivity matrix for schaefer parcellation for individual and makes group average)
2)sch_participationcoef.m (runs participation coefficient for selected nodes)
